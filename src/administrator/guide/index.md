# Administrator Guide

Welcome to the PROJECT_NAME administrator guide. In this section of the
documentation, we aim to show administrators common workflows for managing the
platform effectively. Here is a brief overview of the content provided here:

* **[Accessing the Administration Site:](./access-admin-site.md)** This section
contains a quick description on how administrators can access the
administration site of the PROJECT_NAME platform.

> **Disclaimer:** The workflows described in the guide demonstrate the
necessary workflows for an administrator. If there is a page on the
administration site that you would like to edit but has not been described in
the guide, please do not edit it until you have been in contact with the
development team.
