# Quickstart

## Accessing the Platform

Navigate to the [Home Page](https://SITE_URL/) of the site, where you will be
greeted by the landing page.

## Registration and Logging In

Navigate to the `REGISTER` button on the home page and fill in your details in
the space provided.

You will be redirected to the registration page where you will be prompted to
fill in some information. Namely; your first name, Last name (surname), Email
address you'd like associated with your account, and the password you will use
to log in to the platform. Once you have filled in all of the information click
on the `REGISTER` button at the bottom of the registration window.

A popup will appear letting you know that a verification email will then be
sent to the address you have provided.

Login to your email account and click on the green `VERIFICATION LINK` button
attached in the mail.

This will redirect you to a profile configuration page.

This step will require you to download and install a token generator, such as
the Google Authenticator from the Google Play store. You can install the token
generator on your preferred device (i.e. cellphone, laptop, etc.)

You will use this app to scan the QR code and input the token generated. Keep
in mind that for security purposes, you will have 30-60 seconds to type in the
generated code before a new one is generated.

Once you type in the OTP (one time pin) successfully, you be logged in and
will, once again, be redirected to `Profile Configuration` page. Here you can
click on the `GENERATE BACKUP TOKENS` button to generate `Two-Factor Recovery
Tokens` for your account.

You can use these in future to login to your profile. Additional devices can
also be added as needed.

The next step is to request to be added to the ‘Organisation’ in which you
belong. Navigate to the `ORGANISATIONS` tab on the `Profile COnfiguration`
page. Then click on the `+REQUEST ORGANISATION` button, this will cause a popup
to appear.

In the pop up, you need to fill in the name of the organisation that you would
like to be added to (or have created for you) and a message to the
administrator with any additional information you think is necessary. Once you
have filled in everything, click on the `SEND` button.

This will send your request to the admin team for verification.


## Logging in

Navigate to the home page of the platform and click on either of the two
`LOGIN` buttons.

You will then be redirected to the Login page. Fill in the email address you
used for registration and your password. Then click on `LOGIN`.

You will then be prompted for your Two-Factor Authentication OTP code. Enter
the code from your relevant authenticator app (e.g. Google Authenticator), and
click on `AUTHENTICATE`.

You will then be redirected back to the logged in landing page, from there you
can navigate around the platform.
